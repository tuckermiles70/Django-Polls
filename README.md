# Django-Polls

- My follow through of Django's "Writing your first Django app" located [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/)

- I went through this while in the process of testing out a few Python web frameworks. In my case, I wanted to make a small, simple application, and Django has way, way more than I would ever need for what I have in mind. I think I'll go with Flask for simplicity.
